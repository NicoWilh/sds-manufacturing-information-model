The OMP I4.0 Core Information Model provides a common and standardized definition of relevant manufacturing entities, their attributes, and relationships, including their semantic meaning. The contents of the information model are based on the IEC 62264-1 standard. The Information model is implemented in a set of modularized ontologies. This enables manufacturing enterprises to efficiently integrate data and provide a clear semantic context, thus reducing the time required to generate insights from the data. Furthermore, the OMP I4.0 Core Information Model allows companies to reuse data-processing applications across heterogeneous data sources as the standardized data model acts as an abstraction layer over the heterogeneous data decoupling data sources from data processing applications.
