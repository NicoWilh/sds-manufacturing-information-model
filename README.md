This repository is dedicated to OMP Semantic Data Structuring Working Group (OMP SDS).

It contains the implementation of the OMP I4.0 Core Information Model described in the linked [Whitepaper](https://open-manufacturing.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/101/2022/05/OMP-SDS-Whitepaper_I4.0_Core_Information_Model.pdf) as a set of modularized ontologies.

The OMP I4.0 Core Information Model provides a common and standardized definition of relevant manufacturing entities, their attributes, and relationships, including their semantic meaning. The contents of the information model are based on the [IEC 62264-1 standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/57308.html). The Information model is implemented in a set of modularized ontologies. This enables manufacturing enterprises to efficiently integrate data and provide a clear semantic context, thus reducing the time required to generate insights from the data. Furthermore, the OMP I4.0 Core Information Model allows companies to reuse data-processing applications across heterogeneous data sources as the standardized data model acts as an abstraction layer over the heterogeneous data decoupling data sources from data processing applications.

### Ontology Visualization
![Core Ontology](https://github.com/NicoWilh/sds-manufacturing-information-model/blob/main/OMP_I40_CoreOntology.png)

#### The OMP I4.0 Core Information Model Sub-models:
- Physical Asset Ontology (`phys:`)
- Equipment Ontology (`eqm:`)
- Product Ontology (`prod:`)
- Parameter Ontology (`param:`)
- Product Segment Ontology (`prod-seg:`)
- Process Segment Ontology (`pros-seg:`) 

The file omp-i40-core.ttl imports the ontologies and defines relationships between entities of different modularized ontologies.

#### The OMP I4.0 Core Information Model Use Cases: 
- Manufacturing Traceability: The OMP I4.0 Core Information
Model provides model entities needed to implement manufacturing traceability, starting from
the product model defining a recursive model of the assembled materials to the product
segment model defining entities for the description of the result of manufacturing processes and
individual parts assembly enabling a traceability at both the product definition and product instance level. 
- Manufacturing Process Quality Monitoring: The I4.0 Core Information model provides the means to describe process chains, including process result parameters and their tolerances. This provides the basis for process quality monitoring use cases.
- Asset Inventory: The I4.0 Core Information Model provides with the physical asset model a good way to implement asset inventory use cases in which one needs to know which assets are located in which buildings and
production lines. 
- Production Planning: The I4.0 Core Information model can also be used for production planning. The process model provides a way to describe the general manufacturing processes, whereas the product segment model provides
ways to describe concrete implementations of the process segments for concrete products.
